Indoor Location Finder
======================
This is the client and server for an indoor localiser based on wireless (802.11), gyroscope, and linear accelerometer sensors.

The client is an android app that reads sensor data and feeds it to a server.

The server is written using Flask and processes the sensor data and displays it on a web page.

There is also a DropboxWifiAnalyzer android app that is used for sensor testing
