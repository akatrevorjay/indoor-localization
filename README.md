Indoor Location Finder
======================
This is the client and server for an indoor localiser based on wireless (802.11), gyroscope, and linear accelerometer sensors.

The client is an android app that reads sensor data and feeds it to a server.

The server is written using Flask and processes the sensor data and displays it on a web page.

There is also a DropboxWifiAnalyzer android app that is used for sensor testing

This project was created at Dropbox Hack Week 2013 (August 5-9) by
 - Szymon Sidor @nivwusquorum
 - Albert Wang @albertyw
 - Pedro Amaral @pjamaral
 - Austin Collins @austindcollins

Also note that several files have been purged and readded to the repository because they contained private Dropbox data.  The
git history (and therefore the `git log` and `git blame`) may not necessarily be correct.

We took many ideas from a former Hack Week project.  Their code is at

Thanks to Dropbox, Szymon, and our hosts for inviting us
